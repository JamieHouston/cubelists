##Cube Lists

##Introduction

Currently a work in early stages.  The goal of this project is to create a completely customizable list management system, with any hierarchy, data type, validation, and notifications necessary.

The app uses Angular.js for it's front-end framework, redis for the data store, and node.js to marry the two.

##Prerequesites
The only requirement should be installing and running a local redis server.

##Running
After getting latest, run ./scripts/redis_server.js
Browse to localhost:8000
Have fun
